# Space Cubes Game Rules

## Basic Gameplay
- Control falling blocks in a 3D pit
- Move blocks left/right, forward/backward, and rotate them
- Blocks fall automatically at increasing speeds as you level up
- Game ends if blocks reach the top of the pit

## Block Clearing
There are three ways to clear blocks:

### 1. Layer Clearing
- Fill an entire horizontal layer (all cells in a layer must be filled)
- The layer will disappear with a special effect
- All blocks above will fall down
- Score points based on number of layers cleared

### 2. Horizontal Line Clearing
- Fill a horizontal line with blocks of the same color
- The line will disappear with a special effect
- All blocks above will fall down
- Score points based on number of lines cleared

### 3. Vertical Line Clearing
- Fill a vertical line with blocks of the same color
- The line will disappear with a special effect
- All blocks above will fall down
- Score points based on number of lines cleared

## Scoring
- Points for placing blocks
- Bonus points for clearing layers and lines
- Extra bonus for clearing multiple layers/lines at once
- Special bonus for clearing the entire pit

## Special Blocks
- Special blocks appear periodically
- When placed partially in a hole, they clear the bottom layer
- When placed entirely on top layer, they apply penalties:
  - Score deduction
  - Temporary speed reduction
  - Visual warning effect
  - Negative sound effect

## Controls
- Arrow keys or WASD: Move block
- Space: Drop block quickly
- P: Pause/Resume game
- R: Restart game (when game over)

## Level Progression
- Score points to level up
- Each level increases block falling speed
- Higher levels introduce more complex block shapes
- Maximum speed is capped to maintain playability

## Tips
- Try to clear multiple layers/lines at once for bonus points
- Use special blocks strategically to clear difficult situations
- Plan ahead to create opportunities for line clearing
- Keep the pit as empty as possible to avoid game over
